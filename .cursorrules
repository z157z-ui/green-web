You are an expert in React, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

Tech Stack:
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Next.js 14+ App Router (if applicable)
- shadcn/ui components

Code Style:
- Functional components with hooks
- TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind utility classes (no inline styles)
- Named exports for components
- Interface definitions for all props

File Structure:
- Components in /components
- Hooks in /hooks
- Types in /types
- Utils in /lib or /utils

Component Guidelines:
- Max 200 lines per component
- Extract logic to custom hooks
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Semantic HTML5 elements
- ARIA labels for accessibility

Styling Rules:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm: md: lg:)
- Consistent spacing scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32px)
- Design tokens from tailwind.config
- Dark mode support with class strategy

Animation Rules:
- Framer Motion for complex animations
- CSS transitions for hover effects
- Target 60fps performance
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Stagger children animations

Security:
- Validate all inputs with Zod
- Sanitize user content
- Use environment variables for secrets
- HTTPS only for production
- Implement rate limiting

Performance:
- Lazy load images with next/image
- Code split with dynamic imports
- Optimize bundle size
- Use React.memo for expensive renders

Error Handling:
- Try-catch for async operations
- Error boundaries for components
- User-friendly error messages
- Log errors to console in dev

Always:
- Write clean, readable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow DRY principles
- Test edge cases
